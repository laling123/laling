    <h1><u>NATIONAL SPORTS: ARNIS</u></h1>
	
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What is Arnis?</h2>
      <p>
      <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/arnisintroduction1pptx/257936157">Arnis</a>, also known as <strong><i>Eskrima or Kali</i></strong>, is the national martial art and sport of the Philippines.
	  It is a weapon-based fighting system that primarily focuses on stick fighting but also includes techniques for bladed weapons, empty-hand combat, joint locks, grappling, and self-defense.
	  <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/asia/philippines/articles/arnis-the-philippines-national-sport-and-martial-art">Arnis</a> has been practiced for centuries and was originally used by early Filipino
	  warriors for self-defense and tribal warfare. The main goal of Arnis is to develop self-discipline, physical fitness, and self-defense skills while preserving Filipino martial traditions. 
	  Beyond combat, Arnis plays a crucial role in preserving Filipino history, culture, and identity. It teaches discipline, focus, and adaptability, which are essential in both martial arts and everyday life.
	  Practicing Arnis enhances physical fitness, agility, and reflexes, making it beneficial for overall health. It is also an effective means of self-defense, equipping individuals with practical skills to
	  protect themselves. As part of the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/partner-content-know-before-you-go-the-philippines">Philippine</a> 
	  education curriculum, Arnis helps instill patriotism and appreciation for the countryâ€™s heritage among students. Internationally, it has influenced various martial arts, military training, and action 
	  choreography in films. More than just a sport, Arnis symbolizes the resilience, strength, and ingenuity of the Filipino people.

   <h3 style="color:white;"><strong>History of Arnis</strong></h3>
   <p>Pre-Colonial Origins and Early Influences:</p>

  </div>
   <div class="column" style="background-color: none">
    <p>The roots of <strong>Arnis</strong> can be traced back to pre-Hispanic Filipino fighting techniques used in conflicts between various tribes and kingdoms.  These techniques involved the use of sticks, knives,
	and other improvised weapons.  The current form of Arnis, however, has been influenced by Spanish fencing techniques introduced during the colonial era, along with other Asian martial arts like Silat, 
	brought by traders and settlers from the Malay Archipelago.  Some scholars even theorize that Arnis may have ancient Indian roots, possibly influenced by the stick-based martial art Silambam</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3 style="color:white;">Spanish Colonial Era and the Weapon Ban:</h3>
      <p>The Spanish colonization of the Philippines significantly impacted Arnis. While some historians suggest a strong Spanish influence on the art, others argue that the Spanish names for
	  techniques simply reflect the prevalent language of the time.  What is certain is that the Spanish introduced their own weapon arts and recruited Filipino soldiers and mercenaries, who
	  likely integrated their newly acquired skills into existing Filipino martial traditions.  A decree banning the common people from carrying weapons like the Kampilan and Kris forced Arnis
	  practitioners to adapt, using rattan sticks as substitutes and disguising the art as folk dances to preserve.</p>
